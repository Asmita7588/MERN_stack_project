The Movie Booking System is a web application designed for booking movie tickets and managing seat availability. It allows users to register, log in, browse movies, select seats, and make payments securely. The system includes optional food ordering, providing a menu for users to select and order food and beverages. Real-time seat management ensures seat availability and prevents double bookings. An admin panel is available for managing screens, bookings, and the food menu. The application uses React for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, MongoDB for the database, and Stripe for payment processing. Deployed on Vercel and Render, it offers a seamless user experience and secure transactions.
